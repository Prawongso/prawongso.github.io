(Just long sentence.) Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments.<span class="a">Love</span> is not love Which alters when it's alternation finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O no!it is and ever-fix'ed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken;It is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his heighth be taken. <span class="a">Love's</span> not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compas come; <span class="a">Love</span> alter not between his brief hours and weeks, But bear it out even to the edge of doom: If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
